# COVID-19-Symptom-Based-Prediction-Model-Using-Machine-Learning
Project Overview

This project focuses on the development of a machine learning model capable of predicting COVID-19 test outcomes based on symptoms and demographic data. Utilizing over 50,000 COVID-19 test results, the model employs algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks to achieve a prediction accuracy of over 85%. Our analysis explores symptom correlations, demographic impacts, and employs advanced data manipulation techniques to enhance model performance significantly.
